# Dremio AuthManager for Apache Iceberg - Usage with Spark

## Prerequisites

* Iceberg 1.9.0 or later is required.
* Dremio AuthManager for Apache Iceberg requires Java 11 or later for runtime.
* Dremio AuthManager for Apache Iceberg is meant to be used in conjunction with an Iceberg engine
  runtime jar, e.g. `iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12`.

## Running a Spark Shell

To use the Dremio AuthManager for Apache Iceberg with [Apache Spark], you can use either
the Maven-published artifacts or a downloaded JAR.

[Apache Spark]: https://spark.apache.org/

### Using Maven Artifacts

The recommended way to use Dremio AuthManager with Spark is through the
`--packages` option which will automatically download the artifacts from Maven
Central.

If you are using the `spark-shell`, you can start it with the following command:

```shell
spark-shell \
  --packages org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.9.1,com.dremio.iceberg.authmgr:authmgr-oauth2-runtime:[REPLACE_WITH_VERSION]
```

Similarly, if you are using Spark SQL, you can start it with the following command:

```shell
spark-sql \
  --packages org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.9.1,com.dremio.iceberg.authmgr:authmgr-oauth2-runtime:[REPLACE_WITH_VERSION]
```

You can also add these configurations to your spark-defaults.conf file:

```
spark.jars.packages org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.9.1,com.dremio.iceberg.authmgr:authmgr-oauth2-runtime:[REPLACE_WITH_VERSION]
```

### Using Downloaded JAR

Alternatively, if you're using a downloaded JAR, you can add it to your Spark
classpath using the `--jars` option:

```shell
spark-shell \
  --packages org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.9.1 \
  --jars /path/to/authmgr-oauth2-runtime-x.y.z.jar
```

Similarly, for Spark SQL:

```shell
spark-sql \
  --packages org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.9.1 \
  --jars /path/to/authmgr-oauth2-runtime-x.y.z.jar
```

Or in your spark-defaults.conf file:

```
spark.jars /path/to/authmgr-oauth2-runtime-x.y.z.jar
```

Once the jar is added to the classpath, you can use the Dremio AuthManager for Apache Iceberg in
your Spark applications. See the [configuration](./configuration.md) section for more details on how
to configure the Dremio AuthManager for Apache Iceberg.
